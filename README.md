# jawdread.merlion Media Server

This guide pertains to accessing a media server, which I own and operate. Access to this server will be facilitated through Plex, a freely available software application designed for organizing and streaming media collections from a centralized location.

It is important to note that the provision of this service is currently undertaken as a personal hobby, aimed at testing remote file server and media streaming capabilities. Consequently, access to the server is offered free of charge at this time. However, it should be understood that I do not assume any responsibility for ensuring continued access to the service in the future.

Users who are already utilizing the service are not under any obligation to make payments. Therefore, it can be reiterated that this service remains free while I conduct testing and experimentation.

> Additionally, it is important to acknowledge a limitation of this free service, which is restricted access to TV and browser platforms exclusively. Although a mobile app is available, its usage necessitates payment, although such payment is not obligatory for streaming content.


## Guide to using Plex
1. An email is needed to begin plex media sharing. Once registered an invite will be sent to your email.
2. Check email to confirm registration.
3. You now have full access to my private media server. (Give or take a few minutes for the server to update.)
4. The next steps are just customizations to make your streaming experience more enjoyable.
   
  - Browser View (You only need the 2 Options pinned under the jawdread-merlion media source. Unpin everything else.)
    - Movies
    - TV Shows

  - TV App (Just follow the above instruction of pinning the 2 sources.)
    
  - You can pin other viewing options but viewing results may vary. Do so under your volition.

## Extra Information

While utilizing this service, I will have visibility into the movies and TV shows you've watched. Additionally, I will be able to monitor bandwidth usage. At present, bandwidth consumption is notably low, posing minimal concerns from my perspective.

Although I cannot provide assurances, if the service remains sustainable, there is a possibility that I may offer select users the option to request media to the server.
